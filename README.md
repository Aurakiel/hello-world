About Me
=========
I was born in Greenup County Kentucky, the oldest of three children. I spent a lot of time outside in my childhood helping my grandfather, playing with my cousins, or just reading under my tree. I graduted with honors and began pursing a path toward becoming an Anthropologist. During that journey, I ventured off the path and found myself happily married for 14 years resulting in the birth of my twin boys. Eventually, the road took a bend and I found myself back in college, with two kids to suport on my own. I finished an associates degree in Applied Science and soon began working at the local hospital as a Payor Communications Specialist. My twins are almost teenagers and we have two four legged girls (1 dog and a turtle). I still like to be outside when I can and relaxing with a good book always helps me find my peace.
